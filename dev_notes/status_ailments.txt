There are three class of Status Conditions: NonVolatile, volatile, and volatileBattle.

The NonVolatile ones are the ones that Pokemon store in Pokemon.statusAilment, captured in StatusAilment.
One at a time, new ones don't displace old ones.
They're mostly permanent, although SLP wears off after a certain number of turns.

NonVolatile:BRN
beforeMove:
duringMove:
  attack stat is halved, unless there are stat mods in place; then no effect on attack
afterMove:
  lose 1/16 of maxHP, unless it kills opponent
other:
  rest gets rid of the burn/lose-HP effect, but the decrease in attack doesn't go away

NonVolatile:FRZ
beforeMove:
  if frozen, you can't do anything
duringMove:
afterMove:
other:
  the only way to thaw out is to get hit with a Fire-type move
  weird PP glitch

NonVolatile:PAR
beforeMove:
  25% chance of losing your turn due to full paralysis
duringMove:
  speed stat is 25% of normal, unless you then use a move to change the Speed mod of the Pokemon; then ignore
afterMove:
other:
  Rest cures the afflication, but doesn't fix the Speed reduction

NonVolatile:PSN
beforeMove:
duringMove:
afterMove:
  lose 1/16 of maxHP, unless it kills opponent
other:

NonVolatile:BPSN
beforeMove:
duringMove:
afterMove:
  on turn 1 of BPSN, lose 1 * 1/16 maxHP
  on turn 2 of BPSN, lose 2 * 1/16 maxHP
other:
  switching appears to turn BPSN into PSN
  weird interaction with seeded (Leech Seeded)
  weird interaction with Rest
  weird interaction with Haze

NonVolatile:SLP
lasts for 1-7 turns
beforeMove:
  can't move if asleep, or on the turn you wake up
duringMove:
afterMove:
other:
  Rest puts self to sleep, but for a fixed number of turns

------------

The volatile ones are things like Confusion.
Can have more than one simultaneously.
They tend to wear off when a Pokemon is switched out, or after a certain number of turns.

Volative:Confusion
Once inflicted, wears off after 1-4 attacking turns
beforeMove:
  decide with 50-50 chance whether to use selected attack or hurt self with 40-power typeless physical attack
duringMove:
afterMove:
other:
  moves that take multiple turns only count as 1 attacking turn

Volative:Flinch
A one-turn status that prevents a Pokemon from attacking
If the Pokemon who attacks first inflicts a flinch, then the second Pokemon will just spazz out
beforeMove:
  check if opponent inflicted Flinch; if so, do nothing
duringMove:
afterMove:
other:

Volative:PartiallyTrapped
Certain moves cause this to happen: Wrap, Bind, Clamp, and Fire Spin
Damage is inflicted for 2-5 turns (37.5, 37.5, 12.5, 12.5)
Every attack does the same amount of damage, so critical hits carry over into later turns
The attacking/trapping Pokemon can still choose to attack
beforeMove:
  check if opponent inflicted Flinch; if so, do nothing
duringMove:
afterMove:
other:
  read the description carefully... there's some weird stuff here

Volatile:Seeded
Caused by Leech Seed
Each turn, a seeded Pokemon loses 1/16 of its maxHP and the opponent gains that same amount
Grass-type Pokemon cannot be seeded
beforeMove:
duringMove:
afterMove:
  if you didn't KO the opponent and you're seeded, then transfer 1/16 maxHP to active opponent
other:


-----------
volatileBattle statuses tend to be related to using/charging a specific move.

RANDOM NOTES
Poison kicks in every time you try to attack, immediately after you use your attack.
If you're Wrapped, for example, it'll hurt you each time you sit there spazzing out.
Burn damage also kicks in after you attack.
Both burn and poison also kick in if you switch in, on the same turn that you appear in battle.
Confusion wears off at the beginning of the turn, at which point your Pokemon uses his move unaffected by CFN
