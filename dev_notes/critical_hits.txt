PROBABILITY OF GETTING A CRITICAL HIT
From http://www.psypokes.com/lab/criticalhits.php

For regular moves: ch% rate = (base Speed) * 100 / 512
For Slash, Razor Leaf, Crabhammer, and Karate Chop = (base Speed) * 100 / 64

Round down to 255/256 = 99.6% if above 100%

Critical hits always ignore stat modifiers when they calculate damage dealt.
