GENERAL
- read more about testing, and do more testing with less work
- randomized testing? could be so nice and useful
- process all TODOs in code


POKEMON/MOVES
- HOW TO TEACH POKEMON TEST MOVES, NOW THAT YOU LEARN VIA MOVE INDEX?
- Clean up the Pokemon API in general... seems really crowded
- Define a Pokemon.faint(battle) method that removes Pokemon from all data structures and wraps up Pokemon's existence?

- PP deduction should be moved from Pokemon.useMove to Move.finishUsingMove, and will almost surely require a deductPP method in Pokemon. This allows weird/multi-turn moves to deduct when they want to, which the current system doesn't support
- Continue implementing weird Moves


BATTLES
- Define a Battle.canBeHit(p: Pokemon) method that checks all of its various data structures for all conditions that would prohibit connecting (Dig, Fly, etc.)
- Once Battle.canBeHit is in place, clean up the code that most Move traits/implementations use to figure out if they should proceed with the attack. Maybe pass in a parameter about whether or not it's a move that depends on accuracy?
- Get MoveHistory vs MoveManager figured out. Look at what all Moves that need a history actually need, and then implement it


TRAINERS
- UseFirstAvailableMove shouldn't consider using a Move with 0PP, or one that's disabled. Probably just needs to call canUseMove, once you add a check for disabled.
