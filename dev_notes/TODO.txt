GENERAL
- process all TODOs in code
- Make a Manager abstract class with an abstract method switchOut(p: Pokemon) that all managers inherit from

POKEMON/MOVES
- Continue implementing weird Moves

BATTLES
- Get MoveHistory vs MoveManager figured out. Look at what all Moves that need a history actually need, and then implement it


TRAINERS
- UseFirstAvailableMove shouldn't consider using a Move with 0PP, or one that's disabled. Probably just needs to call canUseMove, once you add a check for disabled.
