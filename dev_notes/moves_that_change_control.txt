There are three different amounts of control that a Trainer can have at the
beginning of his/her turn:

1. Full control. You can select any viable Move your active Pokemon knows, or
you can switch to a different Pokemon. This is the most common case.

2. Partial control. You can switch to a different Pokemon, but if you choose to
Attack instead, then you don't have a choice because something is in motion
from a previous turn.

3. No control. You don't even get the option to Attack or Switch; it just does
something based on something in motion from a previous turn.

This document describes the moves that put you into Case 2 or Case 3; anything
not mentioned in a Case 1 move.
