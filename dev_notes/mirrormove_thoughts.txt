PROBLEM: MirrorMove can't be implemented using the given infrastructure.
NECESSARY PART OF SOLUTION: Make a BattleMoveManager class that's very similar to BattleStatManager
Map Pokemon -> what?
Options:
1. The index of the move that it used last, relative to the Pokemon (in 1..5)
- Problem: If the Pokemon uses Metronome, it'll then use a random attack, and it's that random attack
  that counts as the last move used according to the Metronome move description

2. The move itself, presumably a reference to the move in the Pokemon
- Problem: Again, fails on Metronome.

3. The index of the move that it used last, relative to the move (in 1..165)
Problem: Once I have that information, there's no great way for me to make an instance of that move
and then use it. But it certainly solves the problem with Option 1.

Assume I do have some way to create an instance of that move. Can I use it?
val lastMoveUsed : Move = pb.moveManager.getLastMove(defender)
lastMoveUsed.use(this, defender, pb
